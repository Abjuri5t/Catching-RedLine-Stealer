RedLine Stealer is an infamous malware strain that provides cyber-criminals with a reliable payload for stealing sensitive information from an infected computer. Both MalwareBazaar statistics and ANY.RUN trends consistently track RedLine as the most common payload on their platforms. Redline Stealer is classified by malware taxonomy as an “information stealer” (infostealer). Like many infostealers, RedLine is leveraged by cyber-criminals for reconnaissance and initial access. The information that RedLine steals includes:

 - browser autofill details (login credentials, payment card information, contact information, etc.)
 - session cookies
 - cryptocurrency keys
 - certain files (dependent on configuration)
 - and system details of the infected computer

RedLine Stealer is maintained by professional malware developers who sell access to the infostealer on Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) markets. The purchasing ‘clients’ specialize in infecting victims with RedLine and profiting from that stolen information. RedLine has grown in popularity among cyber-criminals — becoming responsible for a large number of account compromises and resulting damages. A well-known account compromise, attributed to a RedLine Stealer infection, was the 2023 “hack” of Linus Tech Tips — a technology communications YouTube channel with 15+ Million subscribers. In the modern (October 2023) threat landscape, many network defenders consider RedLine Stealer infamous due to the malware’s prevalence and stealing capabilities.
